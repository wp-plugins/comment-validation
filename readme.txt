This plugin adds client-side validation to the Wordpress comment form, using the jQuery validation plugin.

== Description ==

Ever got annoyed when submitting a comment on a wordpress blog and just getting a blank page with a error message like "please fill out required fields" and nothing else? This plugin aims to help by adding validation to the comment form. When a user submits the form and something is missing, an appropiate message is displayed and individual fields are highlighted. When the email or url is in an incorrect format, a message is displayed accordingly.

**Why should you install it?** Because you care for comments and want to help users reduce mistakes that hold them off from commenting at all.

**Whats the technology used?** <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and the <a href="/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/">jQuery Validation plugin</a> with a few customizations to make it fit into the standard Wordpress theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `comment-validation` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
