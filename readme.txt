This plugin adds client-side validation to the Wordpress comment form, using the jQuery validation plugin.

== Description ==

What does the Comment Validation plugin do? It adds client-side form validation to your comment form, helping
commenters to fill out the form. It doesn’t get in the way, so if you fill out fields as usual you’ll never
notice it. It just shows hints and highlights field when something is missing on submit or something has the
wrong format, like email or url (which is still optional).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `comment-validation` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
